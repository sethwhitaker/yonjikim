						<p>Medicrea is a ground breaking medical company that sells rods customised to each patient that needs spinal surgery. I was brought on because they want to create a single full-service platform that helps surgeons plan their surgeries, order products, and conduct post-operative analysis.</p>

						<p>Our main two groups of users are the surgeons and the Medicrea lab team. To gain an understanding of each user, we conducted multiple user interviews and contextual inquiries, and gathered data about surgeons. Then based on this research, I mapped out the primary user flows and created personas.</p>

						<h3 class="h3">Branding Phase</h3>
						<p>Traditionally, Medicrea had focused on a marketing &amp; sales type of relationship with surgeons and hospitals. As the UNiD platform was their first foreway into providing a service, this was an exciting opportunity to create a fresh identity from ground up.</p>

						<h3 class="h3">Design Phase</h3>
						<p>Next, the new branding and user-centric strategy had to be applied to every page, which mean this next phase took the longest. On each page, I designed for each user, refining all actions to allow them to successfully meet their goals.</p>

				<h2>Good Morning! Here are your To-Dos today</h2>
				<p>The first page after logging in, the Dashboard shows you your most urgent tasks for the day and gives you a preview of what’s ahead. All the ways a surgeon or lab member would want to slice or dice their list of open cases, the Dashboard has a shortcut for it.</p>

				<img src="/img/dashboard-v-12.png" alt="">

				<h2>FINDING ONE CASE OUT OF HUNDREDS</h2>
				<p>The goal of Cases is for users to find the specific case memo they needed at a high level. I focus on users filtering by status or timing, sorting the results, and viewing the results either as cards or a list.</p>
				<img src="/img/cases-v-5-b-card.png" alt="">

					</div>
				</div>
				<img src="/img/cases-v-5-b.png" alt="">

				<h2>THE HARDEST WORKING PAGE</h2>
				<p>The Case Memo needs to show the case’s current status, past activity, the next step needed, the surgeon’s brief, the lab’s proposed plan, post-operative analysis, and also allow feedback between the surgeon and lab specialist. That’s a lot! I created a flexible layout that cleanly displays all the different types of information.</p>

				<h2>FORMS, FORMS, FORMS</h2>
				<p>A large part of this platform are form fields. Most designers don’t find this sexy… but I do in a nerdy way. How can I make input fields cute and easy to use?</p>

						<h3 class="h3">Development Phase</h3>
						<p>During the design phase, I worked very closely with the development team in France, using Slack for communication, InVision for prototyping, and Zeplin for asset hand off, to make sure everything was seamless for them. Now, during the development phase, I’m QAing as the developers are finishing. Stay tuned for the launch in the fall!</p>
