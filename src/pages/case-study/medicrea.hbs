						<p>Medicrea is a ground breaking medical company that sells rods customised to each patient that needs spinal surgery. I was brought on because they want to create a single full-service platform that helps surgeons plan their surgeries, order products, and conduct post-operative analysis.</p>

				<h2>Good Morning! Here are your To-Dos today</h2>
				<p>The first page after logging in, the Dashboard shows you your most urgent tasks for the day and gives you a preview of what’s ahead. All the ways a surgeon or lab member would want to slice or dice their list of open cases, the Dashboard has a shortcut for it.</p>

				<img src="/img/dashboard-v-12.png" alt="">

				<h2>FINDING ONE CASE OUT OF HUNDREDS</h2>
				<p>The goal of Cases is for users to find the specific case memo they needed at a high level. I focus on users filtering by status or timing, sorting the results, and viewing the results either as cards or a list.</p>

				<h2>THE HARDEST WORKING PAGE</h2>
				<p>The Case Memo needs to show the case’s current status, past activity, the next step needed, the surgeon’s brief, the lab’s proposed plan, post-operative analysis, and also allow feedback between the surgeon and lab specialist. That’s a lot! I created a flexible layout that cleanly displays all the different types of information.</p>

				<h2>FORMS, FORMS, FORMS</h2>
				<p>A large part of this platform are form fields. Most designers don’t find this sexy… but I do in a nerdy way. How can I make input fields cute and easy to use?</p>
